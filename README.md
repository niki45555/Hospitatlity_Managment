# Room-Availability-Checking-during-Reservation-using-SQL
Project Title: Room Availability Checking during Reservation\
1. Database Schema Design
First, let's define the relational database schema to support the required functionalities.

Tables:

Users:
UserID (Primary Key)
Username
Password
Email
Role (e.g., admin, guest)

Hotels:
HotelID (Primary Key)
HotelName
Location
Description

Rooms:
RoomID (Primary Key)
HotelID (Foreign Key)
RoomNumber
RoomType (e.g., single, double, suite)
Price

Reservations:
ReservationID (Primary Key)
UserID (Foreign Key)
RoomID (Foreign Key)
CheckInDate
CheckOutDate
Status (e.g., booked, checked-in, checked-out, cancelled)

Bills:
BillID (Primary Key)
ReservationID (Foreign Key)
Amount
IssueDate
Status (e.g., paid, unpaid)

3. Integration with Reservation Process
Reservation Process Update
Modify the reservation process to call CheckRoomAvailability before finalizing a reservation.
If the room is available, proceed with the reservation.
If the room is not available, provide alternative options to the user.
User Interface Enhancements
Update the user interface to display room availability status and alternative options during the reservation process.

4 Testing and Validation
Perform unit testing for each stored procedure.
Conduct integration testing to ensure the new feature works seamlessly with the existing system.
Validate the overall functionality with end-to-end testing.

Resources Required
Access to the hospitality management system codebase.
Documentation and guidelines for system architecture and database schema.
Collaboration with database and frontend teams for integration and testing.
